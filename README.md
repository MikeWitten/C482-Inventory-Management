# C482-Inventory-Management

Hello All.  
This WGU inventory management project uses local memory and is not meant to support a database. This project is meant to show the ability to create graphic user interfaces as well as
 the ability to display, search, and manipulate the objects, lists, and tables in a Java application.    <p>

To all current WGU students.  This project took me about a month to complete, and I relied on youtube, stack overflow, and github to help me understand what I was doing.
  I have added notes to every section of the project to make it easier to understand, borrow, or laugh at.
  please feel free to contact me if you want to go over anything in the project, as I am happy to share and learn with you as you work through your own project. 
  Software 2 has a statement that prohibits using github repositories, but as of 3/9/2022 Software 1 does not have any such limitations that I am aware of.
